4 on the couch - psudedonym tracker

After playing a couple rounds of 4 on the couch I got bored of playing so I made this tracker during game 3 to figure out who everyone is with minimal thinking.


Made with java.

Input all the participants one by one at the top.

Each time a move is made, enter who called the name, what name was called, and who ended up moving

This trackers logic assumes that the player who moved and the player who called switch names.

To run - navigate to directory, and enter 

> javac *.java && java Runner
